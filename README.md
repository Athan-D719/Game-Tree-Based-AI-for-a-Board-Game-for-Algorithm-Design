# Game-Tree-Based-AI-for-a-Board-Game-for-Algorithm-Design

This project implements a game tree-based AI to play a 2D board game. The AI utilizes various data structures, including HashTable, SortedDoublyLinkedList, Stack, Queue, and Deque, to efficiently manage game states, explore potential moves, and optimize performance.

Key Features:

Hash Table: Stores and retrieves game states for quick lookup.
Sorted Doubly Linked List: Manages game states in a sorted order for efficient traversal.
Stack: Used for depth-first traversal of the game tree.
Queue: Used for breadth-first traversal of the game tree (if applicable).
Deque: Used for bidirectional traversal when needed.
Game Tree: Constructs a tree of possible game states to explore potential moves.
Evaluation Function: Scores board states to determine the best move.
Overflow Function: Handles gem overflows according to game rules.
Improvements:

Optional: Implemented additional features (e.g., undo moves, animations, AI difficulty settings) using the specified data structures.

This project demonstrates the understanding of data structures, and algorithms, and the effective use of various data structures contributes to the overall efficiency and performance of static AIs.
